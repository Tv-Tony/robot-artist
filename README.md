This code reads an Excel file and that has x and y coordinates listed and converts these points to movement in the robot, 
by tracing a picture using an online resourse and generating points we can have the robot draw pictures. Below is a pdf explaining the process 
including the code documentation, the current code is a little altered for testing purposes.
